# Led-Belt
Hello my name is Zero and I made a led belt with 2 head lamps and a ws2812b led strip.
I made the belt so I can be seen when I go for walks at night.
The belt has 2 head lamps in the front and the ws2812b led strip goes from the front to the back.
I used an Arduino Nano to control the ws2812b led strip.
I am putting the code I used here.
It is really just an edit of Adafruit's NeoPixel code
I just took the theater Chase and color wipe and made it run for a long time. 
I am new here.
If I mess up somehere let me know so I can learn from my mistakes.
